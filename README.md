# Old Discord Font
![](https://github.com/Overimagine1/old-discord-font/blob/main/images/preview.png)

Simple CSS to revert Discord's 2022 font change back to the Whitney font. [You can preview these changes live here.](https://discord-preview.vercel.app/?file=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Overimagine1/old-discord-font/source.css).

The CSS was made by Discord themselves **(I don't take any credit for the CSS)**, however I'm hosting the fonts on GitHub in order to prevent risk of them being taken off Discord's Servers.
# Is this dead?
No. I'm not going to point fingers, but someone in the BetterDiscord server claimed that this snippet is dead, which isn't true, it just doesn't require much matinence. The BetterDiscord staff and it's members would rather spread disinformation be generally vague about what they say for literally everything than just be transparent. I, alongside many others, have experienced this first hand. It takes a minute to literally test something like this, but they just look at the commit dates and assume it's dead. Ask for support **(NOT ABOUT THIS SNIPPET, SUBMIT AN ISSUE)** or literally say anything there at your own risk.
