# Old Discord Font
![](https://pages.overimagine.xyz/old-discord-font/images/preview.png)

Simple CSS to revert Discord's 2022 font change back to Whitney. [Live preview here](https://discord-preview.vercel.app/?file=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Overimagine1/old-discord-font/source.css).

The CSS was made by Discord themselves **(I don't take any credit for the CSS)**, however I'm hosting the fonts on GitHub in order to prevent risk of them being taken off Discord's Servers.
# Is this dead?
No. I'm not gonna point fingers, but someone in the BD server was claiming that this snippet is dead. It's not, it just doesn't require much matinence. BD server members love to spread misinformation, and claiming this snippet is dead is one of those pieces of misinfo.
